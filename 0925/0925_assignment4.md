## Title: IS590DT Assignment 4
### Date: 09/25 Tue
### Due: 10/02 Tue

For Assignment 4, you will follow the instruction in class (check the jupyter notebook in https://github.com/yingjun2/IS590DT), and repeat the Iris classification on your own machine. 

1) Classification algorithm implementation (2 and 4 credits)

Apart from the SVM classification method, select one or more classification method, and calculate the accuracy. Play with parameters inside the algorithm, and show how you could improve the result.

2) Discover one of the new functions that haven't been demonstrated in class (You may refer to the following) (4 credits) 
 - How to do cross validation
 - How to offer the confusion matrix
 - How to plot the tree visualization when possible
 - Or one topic you come up with.

(2 credit students could do this for a bonus.)

3) Difference between Weka and Python (2 and 4 credits)

Now you've tried both weka and python on how to do data mining on the same IRIS dataset. What's your feeling? And What do you think is the difference. (Is there anything weka could do but python don't, and vice versa? What's the difference in effeciency and flexibility? Are there any examples on the same algorithm but with different results, and why? *bonus*)

200 words or more (2 credits);
500 words or more (4 credits).
