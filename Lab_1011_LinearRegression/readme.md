This file contains brief descriptions.

Try LR (Linear Regression) and MLR (multi-linear regression)

Potential topics:
 - concepts / targets.
 - RSS calculation
 - geometry understanding
 - R example. (Boston house price)
 
Attention:
 - I might need extra preparation on R implementations.
 - cautions students in advance on R and time for the lab. (better before or on Mon.)

Memo:
 - Using bbc, to make it a hybrid class (both online and in-class)
 - Using records for students who cannot make it.
 - Update my channel on Youtube.
